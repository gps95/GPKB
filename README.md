# This is a work in progress and untill stated otherwise it is not recommended to build your own!

# Introduction

This is my custom ergonomic keyboard design, for my own hand dimensions/needs.
It is based on many designs i have seen online, but i wanted to have a go at designing one from scratch.
I also wanted to make the process of making your own as easy as possible.
I wanted a keyboard that would be easy to maintain, highly customizable and cheap.

It consists of 4 rows,7 columns and uses layers for all funcionality of a full sized keyboard on a reduced footprint.
(I will update this part with some visuals for clarification)

Will use cherry mx type,

# What you will need to have to build your own: [this indicates optional]

- V0:
  - 3D printer: For the case, carrying case , [keycaps]
  - Buy: Diodes, Hot swap sockets(mx), Audio jack connectors ,Keyswitches(mx), [keycaps] , [Soldering kit]

  
# Planned models

- V0/Core: Basic easy to make version
  - Base version using soldering
  - No soldering version, using 3D printing to keep things in place
- V1/Xtra: V0 with the extra microcontroller pin used for linear potentiometer / rotary encoder / something else (ideas welcome).
- V2/Wless: V0 but wireless(bluetooth), will not use Seed Xiaos.

As i advance this project i will adjust scope.

# General requirements of each model

- Explanations of why i chose something / how to do something
- List of everything needed
- Nicely organized files

# Requirements V0/Core
 
- Must be split, each side independant: Easy to travel with and versatile.
- Must be hot-swappable: Just solder once and forget (or do not solder at all for that version).
- Case must be almost fully printable -> easy replacements.
- Columns are vertically aligned: |
- Rows adapt to hand shape: .··.
# Folder Structure
?
# Future plans:
Custom PCB for the V0.
Create a V1 using the extra free pin on each side (maybe a linear potentiometer/rotary encoder)
Create a 3D printable carrying case for each model
